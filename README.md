# Checkers

## Description
It's a checkers game that can be played with 2 players.


## Installation
Game requires pygame to be installed in order to run.

## Usage
To play game click a piece and it will show available moves then click the blue cirle to move the piece. Red starts then game and the change of turns is automated.
Jumping multiple pieces is allowed however if you wish to "stop jumping" click anywhere that isn't the blue circle.

## Roadmap
I don't intend to update this project whatsover it was more to allow me to learn the basics of pygame and how to move things on a grid. I intend to use these skills to code a chess game.

## Authors and acknowledgment
The base for the game came from a tutorial by [@TechWithTim](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim) on Youtube.

Spero Caldis (me), coded the new and better piece movement, new board colours and the ability to change the colours of everything more dynamically. Also removed bugs with clicking a valid piece clicking the wrong place and then being unable to move.

## Project status
Project is complete.
